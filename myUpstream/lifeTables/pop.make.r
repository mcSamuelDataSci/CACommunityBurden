# title: pop.make.r
# purpose: datasets of population denominators for CBD project (state, county, tract, mssa)
# notes:
#		acs package: acs::read.acs can read downloaded files from AFF, csv/zip/etc. in case Census API down.
#					 it is not used herein because of CBD project design preference for simple data objects.
#		county and state level use DOF data; tract and MSSA level use ACS data
#		other necessary datasets for life tables/YLLs:
#			- standard populations
#			- age standards for survival
#		mortality (CDPH/NCHS/SEER)
#!		to prepare for race/eth specific results, perhaps introduce placeholder values of race (eg, =0)
#!		do the county labels need to be added to the population datasets at this time or later?

upPlace    <- path(.path,"0.CBD/myUpstream")
.ckey 	   <- read_file(path(upPlace,"census.api.key.txt"))						# raw text file containing API key.

## 1.2  packages
.pkg	<- c("data.table","tidycensus","readr","stringr")
