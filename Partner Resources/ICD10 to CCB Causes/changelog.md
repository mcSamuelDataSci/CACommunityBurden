------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CCB Condition List was updated with the following changes:

1.  Cervical cancer (code B10), which had been inaccurately labeled recently, was correctly renamed to Uterine/Cervical cancer. 

2.  New detail level causes added under the Public Health Level cause Uterine/Cervical cancer (code B10)

    -   B10a – Cervical

    -   B10b – Uterine

3.  New detail level causes added under the Public Health Level cause Brain and nervous system cancers (code B15)

    -   B15a – Malignant

    -   B15b – Non-malignant

4.  There are now two “catch-all” Public Health Level causes for Cancer:

    -   B98 – Other malignant neoplasms

    -   B99 – Other neoplasms

        -   Includes most D00-D48 ICD-10 codes, which represent in-situ, benign, or neoplasms with unknown behavior. These codes were previously under D99 – Other Chronic conditions.
